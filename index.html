            <img src="assets/images/rich_mcrary.jpg" alt="Rich McRary">

            <p>I will be turning 43 this year and I am still trying to figure out my life. I've always been too analytic for my own
                good, so naturally, coding seemed to be a great fit. I enjoy creating and disassembling things to see how
                they "work" and I think this is a perfect avenue to explore and take advantage of this natural tendency.
            </p>

            <p>My hobbies include cooking, music (both recorded and live), video games and traveling. I have studied the Korean
                language and enjoy cooking Korean cuisine as well as any cuisine. I like to look at menus and recreate what
                I ordered at home. My music taste is a HUGE range and I listen to music every chance I can get as well as
                go to concerts, both locally and around the country. I currently have over 200 video games and growing, although
                my time doesn't seem to be growing with the collection size.</p>
